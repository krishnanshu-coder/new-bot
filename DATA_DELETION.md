# Data Deletion Instructions for Upload Bot

This document provides instructions for data deletion related to the "Upload Bot" Facebook application.

## No User Data is Stored

Our application is a simple, automated server-side bot. It uses a Page Access Token to upload videos from a private Google Drive folder to a specific Facebook Page.

The application **does not** request, access, or store any personal data from any Facebook user's profile. There are no user accounts, and no user logs into the app.

Because no user data is ever stored, there is no data to delete.
